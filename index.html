                    <p>CLASS OVERVIEW</p>
                    <h1>Become a true "100 Percenter" & Hit-Maker</h1>
                    <div class="classOverviewText">
                        <p>Ryan Tedder is known as one of the few true “100 percenters”, a music maker that can personally do every step of the process at a high-level — write hooky melodies, write memorable lyrics, compose original music, play every instrument, produce the entire track, perform all the vocals, and mix the final track. Not only can Ryan complete every step, but he understands how to use each step to write and produce mega hits, like “Halo” for Beyonce, “Rumour Has It” for Adele, or “Sucker” for the Jonas Brothers.<br><br>

                            In this class, Ryan Tedder teaches you everything he knows about songwriting and production, helping you develop your full set of skills as a “100 percenter” and a hit-maker.<br>
                            <br>
                            During class, Ryan brings you into his studio and shares with you his entire creative process from start to finish. Follow along with Ryan as he writes, records, and produces three brand new songs completely from scratch, starting from how he finds his initial ideas, all the way through mixing, mastering, and exporting the final tracks.<br><br>
                            
                            For the first song of class, Ryan focuses heavily on the craft of songwriting — melody, lyric, concept, and arrangement. According to Ryan “If you don't have a great underlying song, you don't have anything”, so, for this song, Ryan keeps the production minimal and stripped back. With this kind of production, the song has nothing to hide behind and must be able to stand fully stand on its own. In the process, you’ll learn how to systematically architect songs like a hit-maker.<br><br>
                            
                            For the second song of class, Ryan dives deep into music production and shares his complete production process. This song is a thick, production-heavy pop song, with a wide range of instruments, sounds, layers, and audio effects. Ryan is especially known for his drum production (on songs like “Bleeding Love” for Leona Lewis, “Halo” for Beyonce, “Counting Stars” for OneRepublic, etc.), so this song features Ryan’s proven drum production process — you’ll see exactly how he tunes, pockets, layers, and processes his drum parts.<br><br>
                            
                            For the third song of class, Ryan shares his entire, start-to-finish collaboration process on camera, as he co-writes and produces a new song with artist & producer Cautious Clay. This is a real, raw songwriting session in its entirety. You’ll learn how Ryan approaches collaboration and co-writing sessions, from the initial conversations all the way through exporting the final track, and everything in between.<br><br>
                            
                            Along the way, Ryan explains everything that he’s doing and thinking in detail — every idea, decision, tool, and technique. There’s no where else you can get this level of intimate access to Ryan Tedder’s brain and process.<br><br>
                            
                            By the end of the class, you’ll know everything you need to write and produce hit songs of your own. You’ll develop a complete hit-making toolkit that you can use for the rest of your creative life.</p>
